# Code Summary
1. The class method for the HTTPClient library: http.addheader was used to add an API key as a header for the Endpoint url. This functions as an additional method of user authentication. It was also used to specify the content type for the put function

2. An ADC pin was used to read the analog output of the temperature sensor.

3. The jsondocument function was used to extract and convert the string received from the API to a json object. This was then seperated into two seperate lines and printed on the LCD.

4. A GET function was used to receive the status of the light from the API and a PUT function was used to transmit the temperature value taken from the sensor and a response was received.

# Purpose of Code
This code serves to familiarizes students experienced in using an esp32 to consume an API with integrating that ability with circuit design.
